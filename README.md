# BotsUpV3

This is a project I made to send automatic bulk messages on whatsapp that could be used for marketing/publicity purposes.
This app has an interactive UI for easy operation.
It uses Selenium for the automation.
In order for the app to start, you need to login with your creds which are stored in an SQL database.

After logging in, you need to select a txt file containing the message you want to send.
After that you need to select the excel sheet containing the phone numbers of people you want to send the message to.
After that you can select attachments to send, if you want.
Clicking the send button will take you to whatsApp web portal where you need to scan your with your smartphone.
After that BotsUp will automatically send the message and attachment to all the phone numbers in the excel sheet.
